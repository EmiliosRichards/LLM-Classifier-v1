is my audience_taxonomy_v2025-06.json good right now?




-------ANSWER----------
Your file is 95 % of the way there—nice work.
Below is a quick “QA punch-list” so you can decide whether to ship it exactly as-is or tighten a couple of screws first.

Check	Status in your file	Why it matters	Quick fix (optional)
1. All special buckets present (X_*, F_*, etc.)	✅ Yes	Covers horizontal, size, functional, multi-sided, regulated, catch-alls.	—
2. Short codes are unique & mnemonic	✅ All unique and sensible.	Prevents collisions and keeps debug readable.	—
3. “Functional focus” list complete	Missing F_SALES, F_OPS (if you plan to use them).	Sales/RevOps tools and Ops-platforms are common horizontals.	Add if you expect those products; otherwise ignore for v1.
4. Regulated-sector helper set defined	You have X_REGULATED, great.	Scoring logic needs a list of which verticals are “regulated” to evaluate matches.	In code, define something like:
REG_SET = {"FIN_*", "HC_*", "PUB_*"}
5. Multi-sided bucket naming	Single generic X_MULTIPLATFORM.	Simplest v1 path—good.	Later, you can expand if side-specific matching becomes important.
6. Unknown vs. Other distinction	Clear descriptions.	Keeps log review simple: UNKNOWN = too little info; OTHER = model found something new.	—
7. Spelling & consistency	Only tiny nit: "F_FIN" label says Finance/Accounting Departments—consistent?	Cosmetic only.	—
8. Future extensibility	Plenty of code space left (no two-letter prefix clashes).	Lets you add new verticals without renaming.	—

Suggested tiny patch (if you want full functional coverage)
"F_SALES": "Functional Focus ► Sales / RevOps Departments",
"F_OPS":   "Functional Focus ► Operations / Supply-Chain Teams",
Add those two lines just before X_MULTIPLATFORM and you’re done.

Ship-readiness score: 9/10
You can safely freeze this as v2025-06 and move on to re-labelling partners and writing the prompt.
Anything else you tweak now is polish, not critical path.
